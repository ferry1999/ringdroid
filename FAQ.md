## How do I use Ringdroid? I don't even know where to start! ##

See [UsingRingdroid](UsingRingdroid.md).

## Why does Ringdroid only show some of my songs and not all of them? ##

Ringdroid looks for files on your SD card. Transfer files to your SD card and then disconnect the USB cable so Ringdroid can find them.

Ringdroid only supports **MP3**, **WAV**, **AAC**, **MP4**, **3GPP**, and **AMR** files. The filenames must have the correct extension or Ringdroid will not recognize them! For example, make sure that an MP3 file ends in ".mp3".

**Note for Windows Media users!** By default, Windows Media Player uses WMA as its audio file format. Android supports WMA for playback, but Ringdroid currently doesn't support it for editing, so such files will not show up in the Ringdroid menu. Depending on your facility with Windows, converting WMA files may or may not be easy to do. Consider using [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net) for this task, or ask a friend who uses iTunes to help you out.

If you would like Ringdroid to support an additional file format, tell us which one by [filling out our survey](http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?key=pjClfOcMDHuckMdw44cfgNA).

If you have a file that appears to be in the correct format but Ringdroid has trouble with it, please email the file to ringdroid-support@google.com and we will try to fix the problem in the next version.

## I still don't see all of my files! ##

Try opening the built-in Music app. Do you see all of your music there? If not, then the problem isn't with Ringdroid - Android doesn't see your music at all.

To force Android to see new music files, you need to unmount and mount your SD Card. You can do this by attaching your phone to your computer, or with apps like MountUSB.

## How do I delete ringtones I created? ##

Just open Ringdroid, long-press on the name of a sound and choose Delete from the pop-up menu.

## What information is sent if I opt-in to sending anonymous data to Ringdroid.com? ##

After you've saved at least two ringtones using Ringdroid, you get a prompt that asks you:

**Okay to send anonymous data about the ringtones and other sounds you create to Ringdroid.com so we can collect statistics?**

If you click "OK to send", Ringdroid will upload the following information every time you _save_ a ringtone:
  1. Information about the song (title, artist, album, year, filename)
  1. The Android version number of your phone (like 2.2)
  1. The Ringdroid version
  1. A randomly-generated unique ID to prevent abuse and duplicates

No information about your user name, phone number, or anything personal like that is sent!

If you don't want this information sent, just click "Never" when prompted.

## I clicked "OK to send", but I don't want Ringdroid collecting that information anymore! ##

You can reset Ringdroid to its default settings, which will clear your preferences and your unique ID. That will stop Ringdroid from sending any more data. To reset Ringdroid:

  * Open Settings -> Applications -> Manage Applications -> Ringdroid
  * Click "Clear Data"

## I assigned a ringtone to a contact, but it didn't work! ##

This was a bug in older versions. Upgrade to Ringdroid 2.4 or higher.

## No matter where I move the sliders, it always plays the song from the beginning. ##

This is a bug in the HTC Hero / Droid Eris. Ringdroid 2.3 tries to fix this problem. If you're still experiencing it, reboot your phone and uninstall and reinstall Ringdroid. If that still doesn't fix it, post more information about what kind of phone you have to this list.

## I got an error while saving ##

  1. Is your handset connected to your computer via USB? Try disconnecting it first.
  1. Is your selection very short? Android has problems with very short sound files; try making it at least one second long.
  1. Is there a problem with your SD card? Try removing it and inserting it again.
  1. If all else fails, reboot your handset (turn it off and then on).
  1. If the problem persists, email ringdroid-support@google.com and tell us as much information as possible about the error you're getting.

## It sounds distorted or funny! ##

**Is the original music distorted?** Try opening the original music with the "Music" application. If the original music is distorted too, then the problem is with Android or with the T-mobile G1. Try converting your sound to a different format with a program like Audacity for your PC.

**Is the original fine, but the saved ringtone is distorted?** Please email the file to ringdroid-support@google.com and we will try to fix the problem in the next version.

## I can't hear the alarm! ##

On Android there is a separate volume control for alarms.  Go to the Alarm Clock application, and edit the alarm sound for one of your alarms.  Click on one of the alarm sounds to hear a preview.  If you don't hear anything, or if it's too quiet, press your volume controls while it's playing.  You'll see a pop-up window that shows the alarm volume.

Alternatively, download one of the free "Volume" control applications from the Market, many of which will let you set the volume for Music, Ringtones, and Alarms independently.

## I found a bug! ##

Please check the other questions, above. If it isn't covered, please email your bug report to ringdroid-support@google.com. Please include **as much information as possible**, otherwise there's no way we can help you. If you have a problem with just one particular sound file, please **email us the file**. We don't mind big attachments, so don't be afraid to send us a big file. Please, just one file, though.
